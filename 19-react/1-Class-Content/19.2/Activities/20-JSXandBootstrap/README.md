# JSX and Bootstrap

In this activity, we are reviewing the code base and answering the questions listed as comments.

## Instructions

* Replace the `src` folder of your React app with [src](Unsolved/src). Stop the dev server if it is already running. Start the app in dev mode by running `yarn start`.

* Walk through and explain each component with your partner while answering the questions listed as comments.

### Bonus

* Instead of having your Bootstrap code for the Footer inside the App Component, create a separate component for the Footer. Import and then render this component inside of the App component.
