# **Instructions**

* In this activity, we are going to create a constructor function called "TVShow" which can be used to create objects containing information on new TV Shows.

* Your "TVShow" constructor should be able to take in the following information...

  * The show name
  * The show genre
  * The show budget
  * The show summary

* Now create a method for the constructor that would print all of the information contained within the object to a log.txt file

* Use module.exports to export your TVShow constructor
