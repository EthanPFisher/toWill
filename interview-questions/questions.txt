- difference between undefined and not defined in js:
undefined is the value of avariable that has been declared but does not reference anything, while not defined would refer to something that has not been declared.

- characteristics of an asynchronous function:
runs in the background while other synchronous code continues to run.
can be followed by a "promise" like .then() which only runs after the asynchronous code has finished running.
usually relies on an outside source for a response before continuing (user input, server response, etc.)
